Currently, I am pursuing master's degree in Chemical Engineering at [Rutgers University](http://sol.rutgers.edu){:target="_blank"}, NJ. I am doing thesis with Dr. Nina Shapley on heteroaggregates of chitosan nanoparticles and alginate microparticles and their characteriazation using fluorescence spectroscopy. 

I did my bachelors in chemical engineering from [Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology(VNIT)](http://www.vnit.ac.in){:target="_blank"}, Nagpur, India. After graduating, I worked at [Bharati Web Pvt. Ltd.](http://bharatiweb.in/index.html) as a management trainee for one year. During my role, I managed social media platforms of the company.
