### Current Projects
Currently, I am pursuing master's degree in Chemical Engineering at Rutgers University, NJ. I am doing thesis under guidance of Dr. Nina Shapley on heteroaggregates of chitosan nanoparticles and alginate microparticles and their characteriazation using fluorescence spectroscopy. 
I did my bachelors in chemical engineering from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, India. 


### Previous Projects
I like to play soccer, sometimes read a good book and watch interesting tv series. Sometimes I like to do nothing!
