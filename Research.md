### Current Projects

###Characterization of heteroaggregates of alginate microparticles and chitosan nanoparticles using fluoroscence spectroscopy
(MS thesis, Advisor: Dr. Nina Shapley)

I am working on developing fluorescence spectroscopy as novel method to characterize heteroaggregates of alginate microparticles and chitosan nanoparticles. These heteroaggregates, where surface of each freely suspended microparticle is coated with nanoparticles have wide range of application such as water purification, drug delivery system, flocculating agents etc. When oppositely charged microparticles and nanoparticles are mixed together, aggregation tends to occur. The specific type of interaction and resulting aggregate morphology that occurs is dependent on particle concentration. The different types of interactions can be distinguished at boundaries according to concentration ratios. Unfortunately, particle interaction regime boundaries can only be determined visually by using microscopy or by using not typically available techniques such as ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering. We are developing fluorescence spectroscopy as novel method to distinguish between dispersed vs. agglomerated morphologies using a fluorophore that would give different intensity output in each of the interaction regime. If successful, it can be of great advantage as to identify aggregates in situ using fluorescence spectroscopy. We have been studying different factors such as concentration ratio of alginate and chitosan particles, pH, salt concentration etc. and their effect on interaction regime boundaries of alginate-chitosan hetero-aggregates. We are particularly interested in acidic pH environment and its effect on hetero-aggregates with possible application in drug delivery system. Using laser diffraction scattering, we have obtained particle size distribution of these aggregates to help us understand size dependence on concentration ratio. Our next step is to perform FTIR spectroscopy to understand composition of aggregates. 

### Axial dispersion in rotating cylinders for dilute systems
(Engineering Research Center for Structured organic Particulate Systems, ERC-SOPS)

I am part of the group which is studying axial dispersion in rotating cylinders. Much of previous works have focused on free flowing materials but not as much on cohesive materials.  We are investigating how fast mixing occurs for single as well as binary systems using different excipients and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Since product performance greatly depends on blend homogeneity, consequences of variability can be severe. This project will give us better insight into how mixing is affected by different factors and tools to have better control over the process. We etablished relation between flowability and bed behaviour (cascading, cataracting, centrifuging) for acetaminophen, lactose monohydrate and MCC. We have also determined axial dispersion coefficient from concentration vs axial position profiles measured for series of time points. We presented our initial findings at recent AICHE conference.
